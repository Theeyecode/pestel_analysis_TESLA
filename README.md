# 🔍 PESTEL Analysis of Tesla, Inc.: External Influences on Supply Chain Management

This project explores how external macro-environmental factors—captured through the PESTEL framework—affect Tesla's global supply chain operations. The analysis is part of a broader research project structured in two phases:

### 📘 Project Objective
To evaluate how **Political, Economic, Social, Technological, Environmental, and Legal (PESTEL)** forces influence Tesla’s supply chain, with a particular focus on **critical commodity trade data**, geopolitical events, environmental regulations, and technological innovations.

## 📊 Phase One: Data Collection & Cleaning

**Goals:**
- Gather international trade datasets (e.g., lithium battery imports/exports)
- Convert and clean raw XML/Excel files
- Handle missing values and structure unformatted data into clean, usable tables

**Key Tasks Completed:**
- Cleaned and transformed multiple datasets using Python and Pandas
- Merged data from diverse sources while preserving key analytical columns
- Introduced custom row indexing and ensured consistent schema

---

## 📈 Phase Two (Upcoming): PESTEL-Driven Analysis

This phase will integrate cleaned data into a structured PESTEL framework:
- 🏛️ **Political:** Tariffs, trade tensions, global policy shifts
- 💰 **Economic:** Lithium price trends, inflation impact, supply/demand curves
- 👥 **Social:** Public EV adoption rates, consumer sentiment
- 💡 **Technological:** Battery innovation, production scale
- 🌱 **Environmental:** ESG metrics, emissions regulations
- ⚖️ **Legal:** Trade laws, carbon taxes, international compliance

---

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies

- **Python (Pandas, NumPy)** for data processing
- **Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab** for development
- **Excel** for raw data inspection
- **GitHub** for version control
