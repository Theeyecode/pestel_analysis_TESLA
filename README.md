# PESTEL Analysis of Tesla, Inc.
### External Influences on Global Supply Chain Strategy

This project delivers a data-driven PESTEL analysis of Tesla’s global supply chain, focusing on how **Political**, **Economic**, and **Environmental** factors shape Tesla’s operational risk, sourcing strategy, and expansion opportunities.  

Built as a high-level analytics case study, it leverages global economic indicators, trade data, environmental metrics, and EV-specific datasets — all visualized through an interactive Power BI dashboard.

---

## 🚀 Project Objective

To evaluate how external macro-environmental factors influence Tesla’s supply chain resilience and strategic decisions by analyzing:

- Global political stability and governance effectiveness  
- Regional trade activity and economic performance  
- CO₂ emissions, electricity access, and resource pressure  
- Lithium, cobalt, nickel, and manganese usage for EV batteries  
- BEV/EV adoption trends across key markets  

---

## 🌍 Scope of Analysis

Only P, E, and E (Political, Economic, Environmental) from the PESTEL framework were analyzed quantitatively due to available measurable data.  
Social, Technological, and Legal factors are included at a conceptual level.

The analysis integrates:

- Global governance indicators  
- GDP levels, trade volume & value  
- Regional CO₂ emissions and electricity access  
- EV adoption data (2010–2020)  
- Battery mineral usage trends  

---

## 📊 Power BI Dashboard Overview

The dashboard consists of **four interconnected pages**, each representing a specific analytical lens:

### **1. Global PESTEL Overview**
- Avg CO₂ emissions: **57.45**  
- Avg electricity access: **86.59%**  
- Total critical material usage: **41.98K**  
- Avg government effectiveness: **0.06**

**Key Insight:** Tesla operates in a world where electricity availability is high — but political stability varies significantly across continents.

---

### **2. Trade & Economic Activity**
- Europe, Oceania, and North America lead in **GDP per capita**  
- Asia dominates **global trade volume & value**  
- Top trading countries relevant to Tesla include **Singapore, Netherlands, UK, Canada**

**Interpretation:**  
Tesla’s supply chain is inherently tied to Asia for raw materials and Europe/North America for high-value manufacturing and markets.

---

### **3. Environmental & Socioeconomic Indicators**
- CO₂ emissions highest in industrial regions (South America mining sites highlighted)  
- Electricity access strongly correlated with EV adoption potential  
- Government effectiveness highest in Europe & Oceania  

**Insight:**  
Regions with both high electricity access and high emissions represent Tesla’s strongest market opportunity — a combination of need and readiness.

---

### **4. EV Battery Material & Adoption Trends**
- BEV sales (2010–2020): **China leads**, followed by Europe & U.S.  
- Lithium and nickel usage spike post-2017  
- Cobalt usage remains volatile, increasing supply chain risk  
- EV stock share grew exponentially during the decade  

**Insight:**  
Upstream pressure on lithium and nickel will intensify as EV adoption accelerates globally.

## 📌 Key Insights & Findings

### **1. Political Stability Shapes Supply Chain Risk**
Europe and North America score the highest in governance effectiveness, making them attractive zones for stable long-term operations.  
Africa and parts of Asia introduce geopolitical risk.

### **2. Economic Strength Predicts Market Potential**
High-income nations with strong purchasing power (EU, North America, Oceania) remain Tesla’s most viable consumer markets.

### **3. Environmental Pressures Drive EV Momentum**
Regions with high CO₂ emissions but strong electricity access show the fastest EV adoption — aligning with Tesla’s value proposition.

### **4. Battery Material Dependency Is a Strategic Vulnerability**
Rapid growth in lithium and nickel usage signals:
- Higher future procurement cost  
- Increased exposure to supply chain shocks  
- Need for battery innovation or recycling solutions
